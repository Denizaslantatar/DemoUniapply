                conducted by a single neutral arbitrator and administered by the
                American Arbitration Association, or a similar arbitration
                service selected by the parties. You agree that the venue for
                the arbitration shall be Dade County, in the State of Florida,
                USA. The arbitrator's award shall be final, and judgment may be

                <strong>Class Action Waiver</strong>
                Any arbitration under these Terms and Conditions will take place
                on an individual basis; class arbitrations and
                class/representative/collective actions are not permitted. The

                class member in any putative class, collective and/ or
                representative proceeding, such as in the form of a private
                attorney general action against the other. Further, unless both
                you and UniApplyNow agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not
                consolidate more than one person's claims and may not otherwise
                preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
