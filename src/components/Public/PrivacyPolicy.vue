                The UniApplyNow website may use "cookies" to help you
                personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that
                is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot
                be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.
                Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a
                web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
              </p>
              <p class="text-secondary fs-9">
                One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a
                convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is
                to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific
                page. For example, if you personalize UniApplyNow pages, or
                register with UniApplyNow site or services, a cookie helps
                UniApplyNow to recall your specific information on subsequent
                visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal
                information, such as billing addresses, mailing addresses, and
                so on. When you return to the same UniApplyNow website, the
                information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can
                easily use the UniApplyNow features that you customized.

                modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If
                you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully
